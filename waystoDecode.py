# Decode Ways (LC 91)

# A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded
# into numbers using the following mapping: A -> 1, B -> 2,
# Z -> 26.

# To decode an encoded message, all digits must be grouped
# (e. g. is 12 a 12 (L) or a 1 and a 2 (A, B)?) and then mapped 
# back into letters.

# Given an string s of digits, return the number of ways
# to decode it.

# Any digit except for 0 can represent a letter by itself.
# Digits 1 and 2 can represent the first digit in a letter code,
# where the second digit is any digit for 1 and a digit < 7 for 2.

        # invalid for a two-digit code). However, when we encounter

        # digits. This maneuver returns dp[i] to the pre-zero value dp[i+2]
        # in case a 0 follows 1 or 2: in this situation, only one grouping
        # is possible.

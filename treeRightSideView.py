# Leetcode 199: Binary Tree Right Side View

# Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing
# on the right side of it and return the values of nodes you
# can see ordered from top to bottom.

    # current node is the last one on its level.

    # (row of nodes) to the next.

# Takeaway: remember what the cur_node varible is initialized to!
# It might be very useful.

# Takeaway: think creatively about balancing two requirements 
# during iteration: satisfying the condition of iteration and
# handling edge cases/initial input. E. g. in the second solution
# variant, current node is initialized to sentinel before the loop starts
# so that we have some value in cur_node to conveniently transfer 
# to prev_node. Root + sentinel are added to queue (queue must be 
# nonempty for iteration), and then previous node is set to 
# current node (sentinel) and current node â€” to the root, 
# popped out of the queue. That way we seamlessly start the cycle.

# Goodrich et. al. discuss different implementations
# of a function that, given n, returns nth number
# of fibonacci sequence. One is inefficient and runs
# in exponential time. Another one runs in O(n).
# Here's the linear (O(n)) time implementation. 

# This function is so efficient because it keeps
# track not just of nth Fibonacci element, but also
# of (n-1)th element. (The latter is needed to 
# compute nth element.)
def goodFib(n):
    """ Returns pair of Fibonacci numbers:
    ( F(n), F(n-1) ). n must be >= 0 """

    # we consider 0 to be the 0th element of
    # the Fibonacci sequence, 1 â€” the 1st, etc.

# thing twice or 2**n times: inefficiency!

# Surrounded Regions (Leetcode 130)

# Given an m x n matrix containing "X" and "O", capture
# all the regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by "X".

# A region is captured by flipping all "O"'s into "X"'s in that
# surrounded region.

# Notice that an "O" can't be flipped if either of the following
# is satisfied:
# - It is on the border;
# - It is adjacent to an "O" that should not be flipped.

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def solve(self, board):
        # Idea: iterate through the grid. Save all "O"'s in a set for easy access. 
        # The set designates nodes to be flipped. Save all border "O"'s in a second
        # set: these are the possible starting points to find islands that should not
        # be flipped.
        # Perform BFS around "O"'s that are on the borders. Delete all
        # "O"'s belonging to these islands from the to_flip set (they should
        # not be flipped). 
        # Flip all the "O"'s remaining in the set!
        # Yes, we do need extra space to store the two sets (both sets max out at size n*m),
        # but we gain an advantage in terms of time complexity since we never have to
        # look at "X" nodes during breadth-first search. Moreover, looking up an element
        # in a set or removing it are both O(1) time â€” very convenient.

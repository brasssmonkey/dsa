# Palindrome Partitioning (Leetcode 131)

# Given a string s, partition s so that every substring of
# the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome
# partitionings of s.

        # Space complexity: O(n), where n us the length of the string s. This
        # is the space needed for the recursion stack/function call stack.

        # Time complexity: O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the string s. This
        # is the worst-case time complexity where all the possible substrings
        # are palindromes (id est, the string contains just one letter repeated many
        # times). If we look at the recursive tree for this case, it was 2^n total
        # nodes (2^n possible substrings). For each substring, it takes O(n) time to
        # generate substring and determing if it is a palindrome or not. This gives us
        # time complexity O(n*2^n).

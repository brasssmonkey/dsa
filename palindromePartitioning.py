# Palindrome Partitioning (Leetcode 131)

# Given a string s, partition s so that every substring of
# the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome
# partitionings of s.

                    # this palindrome (with some other palindrome starting with ind
                    # instead, or no other options â€” search at this stage is exhausted.)

        # Space complexity: O(n), where n us the length of the string s. This
        # is the space needed for the recursion stack/function call stack.

        # Time complexity: O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the string s. This
        # is the worst-case time complexity where all the possible substrings
        # are palindromes (id est, the string contains just one letter repeated n
        # times). If we look at the recursive tree for this case, it has 2^n total
        # nodes (2^n possible substrings). For each substring, it takes O(n) time to
        # generate substring and O(n) time to determine if it is a palindrome or not. 
        # This gives us time complexity O(n*2^n).

        # Idea: notice how in this approach, we are repeatedly iterating over the
        # same substring multiple times, and the result is always the same. These
        # are overlapping problems -> we could further optimize this approach by using
        # dynamic programming to determine if a string is a palindrome in constant time.

        # So we can turn this approach into a dynamic programming one by creating
        # a 2D DP array. This would bump space complexity to O(n^2). However,
        # given than substring generation costs O(n) for an n-length substring,
        # time complexity stays O(n*2^n): we just throw out one n-factor that stood
        # for checking whether the string is a palindrome using two pointers. So we multiply
        # the total expression by n one time fewer, but asymptotically the time stays the same.

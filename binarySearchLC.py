# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order
# (all the integers in the array are unique), and an integer target,
# write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, return 
# its index. Otherwise, return -1. 

# Write an algorithm with O(lon n) time complexity.

# Takeaway: distinguish between for an while loops! If you have
# recurion, you likely don't need that while, you need a simple
# if test condition. The multiple execution of a loop would be accomplished
# anyways via recursion.

# O(log n) time complexity for sorted list (O(n) otherwise â€”
# if we were just looking for a number in an unsorted list.
# O(1) space complexity for iterative solution.
# For recursive solution, O(log n) space complexity due to stack use.
